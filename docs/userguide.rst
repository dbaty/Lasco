The web user interface

FIXME: add obligatory screenshots?



Usage of the command-line interface
===================================

Lasco ships with a command-line interface that lets you add and remove
galleries and albums, and grant and revoke users' rights. There is no
corresponding web user interface.

The command-line interface is available through the ``lascocli``
program. It includes its own help: run ``lascocli --help`` for further
details. Running ``lascocli`` will get you to a prompt where you can
issue commands. Type ``help`` for a list of commands.  Type ``help
<command>`` for a short description and the syntax of the given
command.

There is limited auto-completion for most commands. For example, if
the command requires the first argument to be a gallery, press the
``Tab`` key and you will get a list of all galleries.
